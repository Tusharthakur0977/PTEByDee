- **Transcription Pipeline**: Seamless integration with Whisper API
- **Evaluation Integration**: Direct feeding of transcribed text to evaluation service
- **Response Storage**: Storage of both audio URL and transcribed text

**Audio Processing Flow:**
1. Validate audio file format and location
2. Transcribe audio using OpenAI Whisper
3. Pass transcribed text to evaluation service
4. Store both audio URL and transcribed text
5. Return evaluation results to frontend

## Technical Implementation Details

### Audio Recording Configuration

```typescript
// High-quality audio settings
const mediaRecorder = new MediaRecorder(stream, {
  mimeType: 'audio/webm;codecs=opus',
});

// Audio constraints for optimal quality
const audioConstraints = {
  echoCancellation: true,
  noiseSuppression: true,
  sampleRate: 44100,
};
```

### S3 Upload Configuration

```typescript
// Secure file upload with metadata
const uploadCommand = new PutObjectCommand({
  Bucket: process.env.AWS_S3_BUCKET_NAME,
  Key: `audio/user-recordings/${userId}/${timestamp}.webm`,
  Body: audioBuffer,
  ContentType: 'audio/webm',
  Metadata: {
    userId: userId,
    uploadedAt: new Date().toISOString(),
  },
});
```

### OpenAI Whisper Configuration

```typescript
// Optimized transcription settings
const transcription = await openai.audio.transcriptions.create({
  file: audioFileStream,
  model: 'whisper-1',
  language: 'en', // English optimization for PTE
  response_format: 'verbose_json',
  temperature: 0.0, // Deterministic output
});
```

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Read Aloud Question Flow
1. **Preparation Phase**: User reads the text (if preparation time is set)
2. **Recording Phase**: User clicks "Start Recording" and reads aloud
3. **Upload Phase**: Audio automatically uploads to S3 with progress indicator
4. **Processing Phase**: "Processing your recording..." message shown
5. **Transcription Phase**: OpenAI Whisper transcribes the audio (backend)
6. **Evaluation Phase**: Transcribed text is evaluated against original text
7. **Results Phase**: User receives detailed feedback and scoring

### 2. UI Feedback States
- **Recording**: Red pulsing indicator with timer
- **Uploading**: Blue progress bar with percentage
- **Processing**: Spinning loader with processing message
- **Success**: Green checkmark with playback controls
- **Error**: Red error message with retry option

## Error Handling

### Frontend Error Handling
- **Recording Errors**: Microphone permission issues, browser compatibility
- **Upload Errors**: Network issues, file size limits, authentication
- **Processing Errors**: Transcription failures, evaluation errors

### Backend Error Handling
- **File Validation**: Invalid formats, corrupted files, size limits
- **S3 Errors**: Upload failures, permission issues, storage limits
- **Transcription Errors**: API failures, quota limits, unsupported formats
- **Evaluation Errors**: Processing failures, invalid responses

## Security Considerations

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- All audio uploads require user authentication
- User-specific S3 paths prevent unauthorized access
- File metadata includes user ID for audit trails

### 2. File Security
- Audio files stored in secure S3 buckets
- Temporary files automatically cleaned up
- File type validation prevents malicious uploads

### 3. Data Privacy
- Audio files are user-specific and isolated
- Transcribed text is stored securely
- No audio data is retained longer than necessary

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Frontend Optimizations
- Efficient blob handling and memory management
- Progressive upload with real-time progress
- Automatic cleanup of local audio URLs

### 2. Backend Optimizations
- Streaming file downloads from S3
- Efficient temporary file management
- Retry logic with exponential backoff

### 3. API Optimizations
- Optimized Whisper API settings for accuracy
- Efficient error handling and response formatting
- Minimal data transfer and processing overhead
